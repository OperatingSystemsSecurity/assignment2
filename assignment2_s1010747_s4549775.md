# 1
## a
The 8 registers `CR0-CR7` are so called "control registers". They can be used to alter and control the processor's behaviour. `CR1`, as well as `CR5-CR7` are reserved, and trying to write them will result in an exception. By setting specific bits in the remaining registers `CR0`, as well as `CR2-CR4`, we can control the corresponding processor settings.

Register `CR4` is

> used in protected mode to control operations such as virtual-8086 support, enabling I/O breakpoints, page size extension and machine check exceptions. [^1]

While it is probably generally a good idea to not let random user space programs alter processor settings, `CR4` specifically may be dangerous because it is involved in virtualization and paging, which could lead to accessing other process' memory. Especially bit 7 looks very dangerous, as it enables global page translation. [^2]

## b
The segmentation fault occurs at the assembly instruction `mov %cr4, %rax`. This instruction tries to put the content of register `CR4` into register `RAX`.

## c
We were able to reproduce the hello world kernel module, and could see its output with `dmesg`.

## d
The kernel module runs in kernel space (ring 0), so we can access register `CR4` without a problem.
Putting the exact same assembly instruction in the kernel module did not result in a segmentation fault. We could successfully read and print register `CR4`.

To compile and use the module run

```
cd kernel_module
make
insmod kernel_module.ko
rmmod kernel_module.ko
dmesg | tail -2
```

You should see two messages from our module. One message is containing the value of register `CR4`, the other message informs us that the module was unloaded again.

## a
To run the attack, first of all we need to compile the vulnerable program:

```
cd rop
make
```

Next we need to disable ASLR, this can be done via `make disable-aslr`.

The exploit script `exploit.sh` tries to automatically find the path of Libc, but if this does not work, you may have to manually set it like this `libc_path=/path/to/libc ./exploit.sh …`.

To enable debug output, run the script like this `DEBUG=1 ./exploit.sh …`.

As `ropper` is used to find the gadget, so you need to have this installed and on your path.

The script has the following exit codes:

* **1:** The script was called with the wrong number of arguments.
* **2:** The first argument is not an executable file.
* **3:** `ropper` is not on your path.

The exploit script gathers the name buffer's address, the base address of Libc, the offsets of the `system` and `exit` functions, and the offset of the gadget. Then it calculates the actual addresses of the gadget, and both functions using the Libc base address. Next it assembles the payload from this data as follows:

1. string "/bin/sh" (encoded with `xxd -p`)
2. padding consisting of NULL bytes
3. address of the gadget
4. address of "/bin/sh" = address of the name buffer
5. address of the `system` function
6. address of the `exit` function

All addresses are encoded in little endian.

After it generated the payload, our script starts the vulnerable program with the payload as input. If everything goes well, the string "/bin/sh" ends up the the beginning of the buffer, then the padding of NULL bytes skips the rest of the buffer, and the frame pointer after the buffer. The address of the gadget is therefore written over the return address.

When the program tries to return, it returns to the gadget, because we overwrote the original return address. The gadget pops the next value on the stack into register `RDI`, then returns. The system function is called because it is the next thing on the stack. It looks into `RDI` for its first argument, which we made sure is "/bin/sh", so it executes `/bin/sh`, so we have shell access.

The address of the `exit` function was added, so that when returning from the shell we do not get a segmentation fault, but jump into the exit function, which exits gracefully.

After running the exploit with `[DEBUG=1] [libc_path=…] ./exploit vulnerable`, you need to press enter twice, then you have a shell. You can verify this by trying to execute `ls`, or something similar.

## b
## c + d
By examining Libc with `strings /usr/lib/libc.so.6 -tx | grep /bin/sh` we find that Libc itself contains the string "/bin/sh".

We can grab the offset of this string in Libc, and calculate the address of it with the Libc base address. Then we can use this string instead of writing it to the name buffer, so the buffer's size is irrelevant. We just need to know how big it is to use the correct padding. This works for both the 64 byte, as well as the 4 byte version of the program.
